        <Description xml:lang="en">The goal of libosinfo is to provide a single place containing all the information about an operating system that is required in order to provision and manage it in a virtualized environment. It allows applications to
- Query what hardware is supportable by an operating system
- Query what hardware is supportable by a hypervisor
- Determine the optimal hardware for running an operating system on a hypervisor
- Find download location of installable ISO images and Live CDs
- Find the location of online installation trees
- Query the minimum/recommended/maximum CPU/memory/disk resources for an operating system
- Automatically identify what operating system an ISO image is for
- Generate scripts suitable for automating JEOS/Desktop installations
